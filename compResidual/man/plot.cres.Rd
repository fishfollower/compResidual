\title{Plot residual object}
\usage{
\method{plot}{cres}(x, pick_one = NULL, maxLag = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Residual object as returned from one of the residual functions}

\item{pick_one}{Number of the plot to provide if one of the 4 plots printed by default needs to be extracted}

\item{maxLag}{Maximum lag to use for ACF plot}

\item{...}{extra arguments}

\description{
Plot residual object
}
\details{
The function produces a 4 plot overview of the residuals by default or one specific plot if the 'pick_one' argument is provided.

Plot 1: Bubble plot of the residuals
Plot 2: Autocorrelation and cross-correlation plot for all dimensions of the residual matrix (rows, columns and diagonal) with 95% confidence interval
Plot 3: Q-Q plot of the residuals, each color is a row of the residual matrix (i.e. compositional group)
Plot 4: Simple plot of the residuals, each color is a row of the residual matrix (i.e. compositional group)
